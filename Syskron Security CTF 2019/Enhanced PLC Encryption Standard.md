> Our IT department wants us to encrypt our PLC traffic. So we created our own encryption scheme, called the Enhanced PLC Encryption Standard.
> The idea is simple, and brilliant:
- Every PLC gets the shared secret password â€“ this is so long, nobody can brute force it.
- If two devices want to communicate, one of them (A) sends a unique challenge to the other device (B).
- B gets the challenge, and hashes each character of the password with the challenge: response = hash(char + challenge).
- For security purposes, we use SHA-256 here (no insecure MD5 or SHA-1!). We also hash each character separately, so the full password can't be leaked if an attacker records the responses.
- B sends a lot of responses back to A. A knows the length of the password, and the password itself. So A can terminate the connection if responses are missing, or if there are too many responses.
- A also conducts hash(char + challenge), and compares every response. If there is any mismatch, A terminates the connection.
- If every response matches, A and B start to communicate using the shared secret password as the key. We use 3DES in CBC mode here, because our PLCs don't support military-grade AES.
> We sent a sample log to IT. For us, this looks clearly encrypted and secure. Our key is 24 bytes strong. One website says it takes 76 SEXTILLION YEARS to crack this.
> P.S. We didn't find a possibility to implement an IV, so it's 8 times 0.

## Files
A log file called 20191003-epes-test.log was given and the content was a snipped of the self made encryption being used to transfer a message:

## Used tools
- [CyberChef](http://icyberchef.com/)
- Python 3.7

## Solution
The problem was pretty straight forward: Go through every step of the self made encryption and try to reverse it.
As a first step device A sends device B the so called challenge. This is the salt which is then added to every hash operation. The salt is transmitted in clear text.
Then follow 24 messages consisting of a SHA-256 hash.
Because the algorithm hashes every single character on its own it is trivila to brute-force it.
I wrote a little python program to do so:

```python
from hashlib import sha256

hashes = ["5daaa90b563017184bb8dc277f63f02366a59519113b9ac87ba6fd46f93dc1ff",

salt = "VkcV29UKCGbfuZyqea7uKbZ9"
	
for hash in hashes:
	for char in range(255):
		data = str(chr(char) + salt).encode('utf-8')
		if str(sha256(data).hexdigest()) == hash:
			print(chr(char), end="")
```

This outputs:

```
ultras3cr3tpa$$w0rd2019!
```

Now i had the password and the IV(8 zeros) of the 3DES CBC encryption and was able to reverse the 2 messages send between the devices.
The decrypted messages contained the flag.

## Flag
```
